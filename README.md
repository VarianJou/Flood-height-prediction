# Flood Height Prediction Research Project

This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for predicting flood heights using multi-sensor remote sensing data, environmental variables, and advanced spatial analysis techniques.

## Project Overview

The project is a sophisticated flood height prediction system that integrates multiple remote sensing datasets, environmental variables, and advanced machine learning techniques. It consists of five main components:

1. **Enhanced Feature Extraction**: Extracts comprehensive landscape metrics (including vegetation analysis), topographic features, SAR signatures, precipitation data, and soil moisture characteristics around flood locations
2. **Target Generation**: Calculates precise flood depths (height_above) from USGS High Water Mark elevations and DEM data
3. **Advanced Data Processing**: Handles temporal alignment, coordinate system transformations, multi-sensor data fusion, and robust missing data imputation
4. **Multi-Modal Machine Learning**: Implements both traditional ensemble methods (Random Forest) and novel multi-route neural networks with attention-based fusion for flood depth prediction
5. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Provides extensive model diagnostics, residual analysis, and feature importance evaluation
