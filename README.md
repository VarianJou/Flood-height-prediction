# Flood Height Prediction Research Project

This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for predicting flood heights using multi-sensor remote sensing data, environmental variables, and advanced spatial analysis techniques.

2. **Target Generation**: Calculates precise flood depths (height_above) from USGS High Water Mark elevations and DEM data
3. **Advanced Data Processing**: Handles temporal alignment, coordinate system transformations, multi-sensor data fusion, and robust missing data imputation
4. **Multi-Modal Machine Learning**: Implements both traditional ensemble methods (Random Forest) and novel multi-route neural networks with attention-based fusion for flood depth prediction
5. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Provides extensive model diagnostics, residual analysis, and feature importance evaluation
